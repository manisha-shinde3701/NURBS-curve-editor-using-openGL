# NURBS-curve-editor-using-openGL
"Implemented a versatile NURBS Curve Editor supporting quadratic, cubic, and quartic degree curves with both open and closed/cyclic options."
"Developed an interactive control point system allowing users to add, move, and manipulate points in real-time, with automatic curve updating."
"Integrated uniform and non-uniform B-spline modes with dynamic switching, enhancing curve flexibility and control."
"Implemented advanced features such as clamped end conditions, knot vector manipulation, and ring-curve mode for closed loop curves."
"Created a robust verification system using OpenGL's gluNurbsCurve() function to ensure accuracy of custom NURBS implementation."
"Designed an efficient poly-Bezier curve representation system for NURBS, optimizing rendering performance."
"Incorporated a data persistence feature, allowing users to save and load curve data, enhancing project usability."
"Utilized C++, OpenGL, and Visual Studio 2021 to create a high-performance, real-time curve editing and visualization system."
