 Bezier curves, B-splines, and NURBS are powerful mathematical tools used in computer graphics and CAD/CAM to create and manipulate smooth, complex curves and surfaces. These

They used something called a spline.
A spline was a long, flexible piece of plastic or wood with a rectangular cross-section. The spline was held in place by grounding it against a drawing board with heavy lead weights that had protrusions called ducks. The spline would then mold itself based on where the ducks kept it fixed. Moving the ducks meant altering the shape of the spline.

The curve passes through the first and last points and is influenced by the intermediate control points, creating a smooth, intuitive curves. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d4b0771-10fb-4e52-bcf6-3d262e58f695) A B-spline is a piecewise polynomial curve defined by a set of control points. It provides local control, meaning changes to the control points only affect the nearby section of the curve.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe5b446f-4ab5-4722-8a05-1baa0de34c82) NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are a generalization of B-splines that can represent both analytical (e.g., circles) and freeform shapes with a high degree of accuracy.
